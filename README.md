## Special Thanks

This section is where I thank all the people and groups without whom this little workshop would never have been made possible. 

Thank you to INFU for making the first M8 Community Starter Pack. Much of the content in this workshop is taken from that awesome resource you built.

Thank you to all the artists who kindly donated materials (samples, M8 project files, etc...) to help build up the contents for this workshop. Y'all are rad as hell. 

Thank you to the members of the Unofficial M8 Community Jam and its organizers, Sleepside Metro, MrdrCat and MetroGradeGoods/Metro Grade Beats. It's an honor to be part of such a cool group of individuals. 

Thank you to MetroGradeGoods/Metro Grade Beats for providing so many headless cases for the workshop!!! Your donation has saved me from using shrink tubes as cases for all the workshop teensies! 

Thank you to the Houston Public Library system for letting me host these workshops on their premises. Free public spaces like these are incredible and make a huge difference in community-building. 

Thank you to h.em.tx (Houston Electronic Musicians) for being such a great community of synth enthusiasts and musicians and for helping get the word about this workshop out there. Also, thank you for agreeing to be guinea pigs for this workshop. 

Lastly, thank you to Timothy (Tim) Lamb/Trash80 for making this incredible music making device and for making headless avaiable. I know it was originally intended as a "try before you buy" option, but I believe it can also be an amazing tool for musical education.
